# Muh bot

## What is it?

This is the endgame of a stupid joke, Where when someone says me another will say muh to make the word meme (me-muh). Yes this is very stupid.

It is a discord bot which

- When someone sends a message with a word ending in **me** and does not have any following word the bot will send a message saying **muh**.
- Can join a voice channel then will use google speech to text api and when someone says **me** will play audio saying **muh**.
- Stat tracking for number of times saying getting **muhed** on a server.

## Running

`docker-compose up -d`
